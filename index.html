        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Ethernet is the bridge that is used to connect the physical layer to the data link layer. Officially created
            in May 1973 by Bob Metcalfe, Ethernet is the most common and popular LAN device used in the world (Spurgeon,
            2000). Over the years, Ethernet has evolved and been adjusted to fit the needs of the ever shifting digital
            world however it has always maintained its primary function of allowing digital networks to be established
            and grow.</p>
        <p>This report will give a history on how the Ethernet came to be, how it’s evolved over the years, as well as
            give some explanation on what it is and how it works.</p>
        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <h3 id="aloha">The Aloha Network</h3>
        <p>Prior to the official creation of the Ethernet in 1973, there was an earlier version created at the
            University of Hawaii in the late 1960’s that worked on similar principles. Norman Abramson and his
            colleagues designed the system for communicating between the different Hawaiian Islands.</p>
        <p>The Aloha protocol, more commonly addressed as pure Aloha (Spurgeon, 2000), would allow a station to send a
            signal at will and then, when the other device received the data, it would send back a confirmation message
            indicating
            that it was delivered successfully. If the acknowledgement wasn’t received back, then if would attempt to
            send the data again after a random delay under the safe assumption that the data had been corrupted during
            transmission and not received properly. This is also the basis in collision protection that is still used
            when sending data over the Internet today.</p>
        <p>Abramson and his team would continue to fine tune the Aloha system over the years and they are credited as
            the creators of LAN’s as we know them today.</p>
        <h3 id="metcalfe">Work of Bob Metcalfe</h3>
        <p>Bob Metcalfe heard about the Aloha Protocol and came up with methods to improve on how the information was
            sent. The main improvement he made was on how the computers noticed that a collision of data had happened.
            To attempt to prevent this from happening, Metcalfe made it so the system would attempt to see if another
            system was sending data to them prior to sending any data itself. Finally, he made it so multiple locations
            could access the same channel remotely. All of these together, are what lead to the Ethernet Protocol being
            called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detect or CSMA/CD (Spurgeon, 2000).</p>
        <h3 id="xerox">Xerox and Patents</h3>
        <p>Metcalfe and his partners tested the prototype version of the Ethernet in 1972 at Xerox Alto to connect the
            systems servers and laser printers. In July 1977 and 1978, Xerox would file to receive patents on the
            Ethernet design and held exclusive rights to the design until 1980 when Xerox, DEC and Intel worked together
            to standardize the system for wider commercial use and, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
            Engineers (IEEE) would convince them it was in the benefit of all to have it become an open network standard
            so as to not limit the evolution of computer technology (Spurgeon, 2000).</p>
        <p>In 1982, Xerox officially gave up their trademark on Ethernet as a name making Ethernet the first open LAN
            standard in the world and was partially important in paving the way for a lot of computer technologies
            following suite as companies started to realize the importance of the world being able to use this
            technology rather than have it limited and piecemealed between corporations.</p>
        <h2 id="ethernet">What Is Ethernet?</h2>
        <p>While we in the public will tend to call it Ethernet out of simplicity, the official term used for Ethernet
            is 802.3. This is done by IEEE to not appear to be directly affiliated with creators of technology as the
            idea behind the organization is that any standards they approve are meant for everyone and shouldn’t be
            owned by a specific company. </p>
        <p>Referring to Ethernet as 802.3 has an additional benefit where, when improvements on the Ethernet had been
            made, they didn’t need to change what the product was called (figure 1). As such, even though we still call
            what Xerox has developed “Ethernet”, it is not the exact same system that was made by Metcalfe all those
            years ago. Ethernet has incorporated developments in technology like twisted-pairs (802.3i in 1990), fiber
            optics (802.3j in 1993) and Link aggregation for parallel links (802.3ad in 2000). The capabilities of
            Ethernet has improved drastically over the last few decades since it was first thought up however it still
            has the same framework that was created all those years ago.</p>

        <p>Ethernet is part of the Data link layer which is important for data transmission and reception. The name
            Ethernet was chosen in reference to “luminiferous ether” which, at the time, was how it was believed
            electromagnetic waves traversed space (Spurgeon, 2000).</p>
        <h2 id="works">How Ethernet Works</h2>
        <p>As mentioned in the section above, Ethernet has changed its form slightly over the years. While the physical
            elements have changed over time, the overall method of data transmission has remained constant in that the
            data is transferred via a cable. Originally this was done with coaxial cables but, as technology improved,
            the data is now being sent with fiber optic cables.</p>
        <p>This has drastically increased the potential data transmission speed. In 1973, when Bob Metcalfe was first
            designing the idea, the top capability of Ethernet was only 2.94 Mbps. Even the official original standard
            produced by DIX was only for 10 Mbps which, while considered extremely fast at the time, is a shadow of the
            current speeds that are up to 100 Gbps (while that is the max speed, it’s still mostly at the 10 Gbps as the
            infrastructure is expanded to accommodate the improved capabilities which is still tenfold the possibility
            of the original patent).</p>
        <p>On the Physical Layer side, Ethernet uses waves (either electromagnetic for older cables or light waves for
            fiber optics) to pass the information from one device to another.</p>
        <p>On the Data Link Layer side, Ethernet will check to see if said information has been received by sending a
            ping back to the original machine to inform them that the package has been received successfully. If this
            ping is not received, then the sender will attempt to send the information again assuming that the data had
            been lost either through a collision with data heading the other way or some other form of data corruption
            like attenuation. The Data Link Layer will have them wait a random amount of time to try and prevent a
            repeat error for if it was caused by a collision as, that way, the other signal will hopefully be sent at a
            different time and will not have a repeat collision.</p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>It is no exaggeration to say that Ethernet, and its similar technologies, are heavily responsible for the
            explosive acceleration into The Fourth Industrial Revolution that our world is currently experiencing as
            technology continues to develop at an exponential rate. As further advancement in computers happen, the
            physical aspect of the Ethernet may be less and less important as we move to technologies like WiFi and
            Starlink, however, the Data Link aspect of Ethernet will likely always be present in some form going forward
            as it is the foundation that the Data Link layer was build off of.</p>
